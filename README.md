# Welcome to this website!

This is basically just where I'd post stuff.  *LIIIIKE...*

Markdown tip #1:
Never, ever, type `___HI___` and not `***HI***`  in markdown.  Although this is fine for some, there are compatibility issues.

Incorrect `___HI___`:
___HI___

Correct `***HI***`:
***HI***
For some people, it is the same, but for others, it is not.


Markdown tip #2:
Correct(`# Heading`):

# Heading

Incorrect(`#Heading`):

#Heading
